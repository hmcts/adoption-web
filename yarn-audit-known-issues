If there are two user-controlled parameters on the same line used in the views, it was possible to inject cross site scripting payloads using the backslash `\\` character.\n\n#### Example\nIf the user-controlled parameters were used in the views similar to the following:\n```\n<script>\nlet testObject = { lang: '{{ lang }}', place: '{{ place }}' };\n</script>\n```\n\nIt is possible to inject XSS payload using the below parameters:\n```\nhttps://<application-url>/?lang=jp\\&place=};alert(document.domain)//\n```\n\n### Patches\nThe issue was patched in version 3.2.4.\n\n### References\n\n- https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1825980\n","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-x77j-w7wf-fjmw"}}}
